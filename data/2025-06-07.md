### [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)

#### Abstract

> Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold -- much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions -- such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide -- but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

#### Abstract

> We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza, anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result, structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

#### 中文摘要 (Abstract in Chinese)

> 医学数据范围广泛，从基因组序列和视网膜照片到结构化的实验室结果和非结构化的临床叙述。尽管这些模式看起来截然不同，但许多模式编码了关于单一潜在生理状态的收敛信息。潜在空间假设将每个观察结果视为一个统一的、分层组织的流形的投影——很像同一个三维物体投下的阴影。在这个学习到的几何表示中，个体的健康状态占据一个点，疾病进展追踪一个轨迹，治疗干预对应于一个有向向量。在共享空间中解释异构证据提供了一种原则性的方法来重新检查同名疾病——如帕金森病或克罗恩病——这些疾病常常掩盖了多种病理生理实体，并涉及比之前认为的更广泛的解剖学领域。通过揭示亚轨迹和患者特异性变化方向，该框架为个性化诊断、纵向监测和定制治疗提供了定量的理由，使临床实践从按潜在误导性标签分组转向导航每个人独特的轨迹。挑战依然存在——偏差放大、罕见疾病的数据稀缺、隐私以及相关性-因果关系分歧——但规模感知编码器、纵向数据流上的持续学习以及基于扰动的验证提供了合理的前进路径。

#### 中文摘要 (Abstract in Chinese)

> 我们介绍了AbBiBench（抗体结合基准测试），这是一个用于抗体结合亲和力成熟和设计的基准框架。与现有的抗体评估策略依赖于抗体本身及其与天然抗体的相似性（例如，氨基酸同一性率、结构RMSD）不同，AbBiBench将抗体-抗原（Ab-Ag）复合物视为一个功能单元，并通过测量Ab-Ag复合物上蛋白质模型的可能性来评估抗体设计与给定抗原结合的潜力。我们首先整理、标准化并分享了9个数据集，其中包含9个抗原（涉及流感、抗溶菌酶、HER2、VEGF、整合素和SARS-CoV-2）和155,853个重链突变抗体。使用这些数据集，我们系统地比较了14个蛋白质模型，包括掩蔽语言模型、自回归语言模型、反向折叠模型、基于扩散的生成模型和几何图模型。模型可能性和实验亲和力值之间的相关性用于评估模型性能。此外，在一个提高抗体F045-092与抗原流感H1N1的结合亲和力的案例研究中，我们通过抽样一组与抗原结合的新抗体，并根据Ab-Ag复合物的结构完整性和生物物理特性对其进行排序，评估了表现最佳模型的生成能力。结果表明，结构条件下的反向折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现优于其他模型。总的来说，AbBiBench提供了一个统一的、生物学基础的评估框架，以促进更有效、功能感知的抗体设计模型的开发。

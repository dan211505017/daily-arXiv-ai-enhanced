This makes\nthe characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their\nactivity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that\nrequire linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging\ngaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)\ndiscovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from\nmicro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining\nparticle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary\nexperiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate\nfive state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of\ncalcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated\non both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal\nvariations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods\naccurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE\ndiscovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from\nmicroscopic data."}

Despite significant strides in the decades since its discovery, a clear\nbasis is yet to be established for the Warburg effect and why cancer cells show\nsuch a preference for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we draw on what is\nknown about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and\noverflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis\nin cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From\nmicrobes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are\nsometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no\nmeans a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at\nthe cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must\nbe considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a\nrange of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual\nframework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation\nof the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies. Such a framework\nis also readily integrated with dynamical systems modelling, making it a\npromising avenue for new answers to the age-old question of why cells, from\ncancers to microbes, choose the metabolic strategies they do."}

Although early detection is\nthe only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness\nabout cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We\ndeveloped an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to\nbreast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to\nprovide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based\non the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the\nhealth card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct\nawareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision\ntree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical\ncancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively.

This paper explores the human niche through\nthe lens of macroecological scaling theory, seeking to define and quantify the\ndimensions along which human ecological strategies have diversified. By\nleveraging concepts from classic niche theory, niche construction, and complex\nadaptive systems, I develop a framework for understanding human ecology as both\npredictable within mammalian scaling relationships and uniquely divergent due\nto social, cognitive, and technological factors. Key dimensions of the human\nniche-metabolism, cognition, sociality, and computation-are examined through\nscaling laws that structure human interactions with the environment and each\nother. The paper demonstrates how human niche expansion over evolutionary time\nhas been characterized by increasing metabolic consumption, information\nprocessing capacity, and the formation of larger, more interconnected social\nnetworks. This cumulative trajectory has led to the unprecedented scale of\ncontemporary human societies, with implications for sustainability, economic\ndevelopment, and future niche expansion, including into space. The study\nunderscores the need for an integrative, quantitative approach to human ecology\nthat situates human adaptability within broader ecological and evolutionary\nconstraints."}

However, it remains\nchallenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes\nor peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial\nbiological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed\nto integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature\nselection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a\npatch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words\n(tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space\nduality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional,\nsparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive\nlearning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables\nsuperior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods.\nSystematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological\nvariation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as\nclustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings\nposition scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics\nintegration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological\ndiscovery."}

Santos", "Christian Hilbe"], "title": "Evolution of boundedly rational learning in games", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "math.DS", "nlin.AO", "physics.soc-ph"], "comment": null, "summary": "People make strategic decisions multiple times a day. We act strategically in\nnegotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose\nwith whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary\ngame theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over\ntime, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial\nquantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity\nregulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the\nchoice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning\nprocess in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is\noften interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take\nselection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the\nindividuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The\nendpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction\nin place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases\nindefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it\ncan either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching\naltogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection\nstrengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning\nmechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is\nnot only a by-product of cognitive constraints. Instead it might also evolve as\na means to gain strategic advantages."}

Polarized microtubule arrays are key\nto facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules\nalso undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the\nfilaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent\nmicrotubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and\nnew filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain\ntheir biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their\npolarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton\norganization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of\nmicrotubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could\ngenerate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time\nMarkov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize\ntwo experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where\nthe direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a\ncheckpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite\nto the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these\nvalidated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback\nis sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths,\nand that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is robust in spite of\nstochastic fluctuations. This work provides a framework to study the\nrelationship between microtubule nucleation and polarity, and could extend to\ngive insights into mechanisms that drive the formation of polarized filament\narrays in other biological settings."}

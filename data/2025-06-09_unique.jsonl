Unlike existing\nantibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity\nto natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench\nconsiders an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and\nevaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by\nmeasuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein\nmodels including masked language models, autoregressive language models,\ninverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph\nmodels. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to\nincrease binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we\nevaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of\nnew antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural\nintegrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,\nstructure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity\ncorrelation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,\nbiologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of\nmore effective, function-aware antibody design models."}

Direct reciprocity, where\nactions are based on past encounters, is a key mechanism fostering cooperation.\nHowever, most studies assume synchronous decision-making, whereas real-world\ninteractions are often asynchronous, with individuals acting in sequence. This\nasynchrony can undermine standard cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat and\nWin-Stay Lose-Shift. To better understand cooperation in real-world contexts,\nit is crucial to explore the theory of direct reciprocity in asynchronous\ninteractions. To address this, we introduce a framework based on asynchronous\nstochastic games, incorporating asynchronous decisions and dynamic\nenvironmental feedback. We analytically derive the conditions under which\nstrategies form cooperative Nash equilibria. Our results demonstrate that the\norder of interactions can significantly alter outcomes: interaction asynchrony\ngenerally inhibits cooperation, except under specific conditions where\nenvironmental feedback effectively mitigates its negative impact. When\nenvironmental feedback is incorporated, a variety of stable reciprocal\nstrategies can be sustained. Notably, above a critical environmental threshold,\nany cooperative strategy can form a Nash equilibrium. Overall, our work\nunderscores the importance of interaction order in long-term evolutionary\nprocesses and highlights the pivotal role of environmental feedback in\nstabilizing cooperation in asynchronous interactions."}

A central idea of the model\nis to include the immune system as an extinction threshold, similar to the\nstrong Allee effect in population biology. We first identify the limitations of\ncommonly used Allee effect models in reproducing typical cancer progression. We\nthen address these limitations by deriving a new model that incorporates: (i)\nrandom mutations of stem cells at a rate that increases with age and (ii)\nimmune response whose strength may also vary over time.\n  Our model accurately reproduces a wide range of real-world cancer data: the\ntypical age-specific cumulative risk of most human cancers, the progression of\nbreast cancer in mice, and the unusual age-specific cumulative risk of breast\ncancer in women. In the last case, we use a moving extinction threshold to\nreflect the different immune response at different phases of the menstrual\ncycle and menopausal treatment.

In particular, the\nentropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics,\nremain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between\nprotein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain\ndeeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we\ninvestigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary\nhistory: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2\nreceptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through\nMolecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical\ndifferences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike\nprotein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more\nstable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in\ntheir unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed\nafter binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole\ndriving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized\nby a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but\ncould optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest\nthat to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the\nstability of the two isolated partners should be investigated."}

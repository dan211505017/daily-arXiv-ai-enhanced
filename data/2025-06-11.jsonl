This hypothesis integrates Bystryn's antibody\nfeedback phenomenon and Imbiakha's immune cost theory, proposing for the first\ntime a \"Consumption-Driven Dynamic Competition of Antibody Clones\" mechanism.\nThis mechanism posits that the immune system may regulate the proliferation and\ndifferentiation of corresponding B cell clones by sensing and responding to the\nconsumption rate of specific antibodies. This competition, driven by\ndifferences in consumption rates, might not only influence pathogen clearance\nefficiency and associated acute pathology during the antigen growth phase but\nalso critically mediate the onset, development, and even resolution of\npost-infection sequelae during the antigen decay and homeostasis\nre-establishment phases. The proposed three-phase \"consumption-driven dynamic\ncompetition\" model provides a unified and dynamic explanatory framework for\nunderstanding the significant individual variability and dynamic evolution of\npost-infection immune outcomes (including the emergence and self-limitation of\nacute symptoms, the formation and persistence of chronic sequelae, and symptom\nfluctuations or resolution). It emphasizes not just specific molecules but the\nmacroscopic dynamics of competition and selection within the immune system,\noffering a theoretical basis for exploring new intervention strategies for\nsequelae (e.g., by regulating the balance of antibody competition)."}
